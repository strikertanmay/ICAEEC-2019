                        This project develops a reasoning and decision support system for the Lifestyle diseases. The Lifestyle diseases are increasingly becoming widespread with the increasing stress levels of the modern youth. Technological advancements can be used for early detection, diagnosis, prevention, decision support and for advising the patient related to such diseases. Such systems are of immense help due to the benefits provided, thus saving the doctorâ€™s time while also achieving high accuracy of decisions made, that can be ultimately attested by the doctor. The Machine Learning systems enable making rules without the need of the doctor, based only on a historical dataset. At the same time text mining and semantic reasoning based systems enable making use of knowledge available as raw text from doctors and scholars. The system on the whole can continuously interacts with the user to be more effective.

                        This project uses the concepts of Big Data and Cyber Physical systems in order to make such a system. A lot of sensors are commercially available that give the body vitals of the human beings. The same sensors can be used to link the raw sensor readings to the medical state of the human being. The easy availability of subjects combined with the high dimensionality of the sensors results in a very large amount of data, thus requiring processing through big data centres. The back end of the system will require sophisticated machine learning tools and techniques, operating in a distributed mechanism. The machine learning algorithms shall capture both the temporal trends of the data, as well as the spatial features that enable making wise decisions. The project also explores the notion of text mining and semantic reasoning, thus benefiting from the wide variety of literature available for the domain. This enables the patients and the doctors to carry more focused searchers and enables more informed decision making. The project interacts with the users using specially made interfaces consisting of web, mobile and a socialistic humanoid robot.

                    <p class="lead">
                        Through this project the aim is to make a complete system using which the users can get an early indication of the development of the disease, the patients can get regular monitoring and assistance regarding the disease, as well as the doctors can get help in the diagnosis of the disease. The complete system is powered by the innovative machine learning algorithm that the group aims to develop as a part of the project. At the same time the system draws its decision making capability based on the text mining done on medical data collected from different sources, represented in an ontological framework.

                    <p class="lead">
                        The system on the whole will be able to give personalized recommendations based on and learning from an individual user, or make collaborative decisions and recommendations based on the learning from a population constituting all the users.

                        The biggest advantage of the project is the complimentary of the teams coming from India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Each of the groups has a unique contribution towards the project. The Indian team primarily contributing towards the Machine Learning and Socialistic Interaction with the user; the Malaysian team specializing and contributing towards the Big Data aspect; while the Indonesian team adds the text mining aspect to the project. Besides, having three different teams collect data at three different nationalities with different subjects and under different contexts, gives the possibility to create a unique data set for which a lot of research can be done in the future.
