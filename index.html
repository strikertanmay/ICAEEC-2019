                    In the modern day, we look at the system as a whole, starting from some sensors recording data, to intelligent decision making, and thereafter producing a physical effect on the environment by using actuators, operating in a feedback cycle mechanism to constantly control the system so as to reach a desired condition. Further, attributed to the widespread internet connectivity of small and large devices and advancements in Internet-of-Things, all sources of data generation, processing and actuation are inter-connected in a cyber-world, giving rise to Cyber Physical Systems.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                    Attributed to a large number of sensors actively working in different domains, the amount of data available for any problem by practical systems of today has exponentially increased. The sensors continuously fire high dimensional data that keeps getting populated in the database. Further, there is a sudden increase in the computational capability of the modern day systems, attributed to the models of high performance computing using a very large number of distributed computing units. This gives the backbone to analyze and learn from the data. Such Big Data systems have revolutionized computing in different real life applications.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                    Attributed to the small number of doctors catering to the needs of a large number of patients, the difficulty in getting appointments with the doctors, the increasing price of medical support and the extremely busy schedule of the doctors, it is imperative that the doctors cannot cater to all the needs of all the patients, and that many patients are unable to regularly consult the doctor. The role of the Medical Expert Systems is to let machines to some assessment of the patients based on the data generated by numerous sensors and medical reports. The machine assessment is then presented to the doctor, who now has a lesser work to do since he/she already has some information from the machine. The machines can specially be very useful when a regular monitoring of the patient needs to be done, so as to alarm the doctor when the body vitals of the patient show development of some abnormal trends. Similarly, the machines can be used by the prospective patient as a cheap precautionary method, in which case the machine can give an early detection of the disease and advise the person to consult a doctor. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The design of a Medical Expert System typically requires a large number of rules, which is a very difficult task considering the doctors lack expertise in systems and vice versa. A new trend is the use of a machine learning system, wherein a machine is given the reports of the past patients and the observations of the doctor. The machine then tries to learn or find a relation between the inputs in the form of the tests and body sensors, and the observations of the doctor. Hence no extra effort is needed from the doctor’s side, who normally investigates the patient, thereby also generating the data for the medical expert system. The machines can observe the temporal data of the bodyand spot trends that may be very difficult for the doctors to observe. Things like a growing lobe, falling pulse rate, etc. are much easier for the system to observe, based on which that can take more informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                    While there is a limited raw data available or that can be recorded in a small time, the presence of a large number of preexisting information about the diseases is particularly exciting. A large number of medical repositories explain different kinds of diseases, their symptoms, precautionary advises, etc. This information is however is in the form of natural language and is therefore completely unstructured. Mining information from all these sources and representing them in the form of an ontological data set can result in more focused searches for both the doctors and the patients. If such an ontological framework is present, machine tools can be developed that assess the patients and make decisions. Such a framework compliments the data driven machine learning approach as medical decision support system.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                    The machine comprehension of the data generated from the patient is ultimately used for making decisions regarding the presence of disease, increasing/decreasing fatality of the disease, advise on eating habits, daily schedule etc. In some cases the advice is given to the doctor, for which a web or android interface is enough. However, many times the advices need to be given to the patient at home or admitted to the hospital. A component of the project is also to use a socialistic humanoid robot that interacts with the patient just like a nurse would do in the hospital. Being socialistic or human-like in nature, the robot is likely to be more effective than just a mobile or web-interface to which the patients may not readily relate to.

                        The medical domain is a very challenging domain because the doctors seldom have the knowledge of artificial intelligence based systems, while the technologists lack a medical knowledge. The project creates a complete solution to the problem by mixing the diverse technologies of Big Data, Distributed Machine Learning, all knit into the generic framework of Cyber-Physical Systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                        The project proposes the integration of information from two very distinct sources ontology based reasoning and a data-driven machine learning, for a multi-modal decision support system.

                <li>
                        Lifestyle diseases are constantly increasing and are creating problems that need a proper technical attention for early detection, precautionary steps and continuous care and assessment. The project targets this specific type of disease that is both important and much has not yet attracted the interests of the researchers. Correspondingly the project aims to make a novel cyber-physical system architecture, specific to the domain/disease.

                                The first phase of literature review runs in parallel for all the countries. Considering that significantly less work is available in the lifestyle diseases, this phase looks into a lot of literature that will aid in designing of the complete system. This phase is also to develop a clear understanding of the overall project design, and the contributions of each of the parties, especially stressing on the interfaces between the modules.
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                The second phase involves all the design aspects of the data that shall be collected from a variety of sensors. The phase involves making all critical decisions regarding the data, including the choice of sensors, the kind of users whose data is to be recorded, and all strategies to record the data. The phase, backed up with literature, lists out all the lifestyle diseases and the suitable data and sensors for each of them. The frequency of data can be a very important parameter for diseases wherein a temporal trend is important. The optimization of the entire process, so as to most efficiently record the data is of vital importance. The phase also investigates all the publicly available datasets that can be used for the purpose. At the same time the Indonesian side shall work over the design of a suitable ontology that specifically is for the Lifestyle based diseases. The ontology shall be generalized enough to model all the criticalities of the problem, while also enabling an easy representation and easy inference.
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                The third phase is to record the data from different kind of test subjects. The data is multi-modal in nature, wherein different kinds of sensors give data of different types. Further, the nature of the data will be different for different types of lifestyle diseases. The data collection shall be done simultaneously for the Indian and Malaysian side. This will ensure a high diversity of data, for a greater understanding of the problem and better analysis. The data will be acquired for a large duration to get the temporal trends. The acquired data will be pre-processed for removal of noise and segmenting out the effective part of the data. Further, strategies to integrate data from different sensors and different modalities shall be made. All data shall be hosted at the Malaysian side, which shall act as a central repository for the data. The Indonesian side, during this phase shall be involved in designing of algorithms for mining of text from different sources available for lifestyle diseases. Again the different sources have their own structure and peculiarities that makes the design of suitable algorithms a challenging affair. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                The fourth phase is devoted to the development of the Big Data based machine learning and decision support system solutions for the acquired data. The first way to look at the problem is to see the temporal data to fetch the trends. One can look at the same patient’s data along with time to understand whether the person is slowly growing tendency of being diseased, or the person’s disease is growing/’reducing with time. A temporal analysis can also be used to predict the recovery or the development of a disease for the person. Similarly looking at the temporal data of the whole population, one can infer the trend of a particular disease and hence make decisions at a macroscopic level, whether some specific actions need to be taken. The data can also be used to understand the patterns that ultimately lead to a disease. In the same phase, the Indian and the Malaysian side shall simultaneously design a set of machine learning algorithms that help in disease identification. The Indian side shall be focused towards the design of innovative paradigms, specifically inclined towards the temporal aspects of the data. The Indian side shall also focus upon the choice of features, both from the temporal and spatial domain, and the selection of features out of all features possible. The Malaysian side shall focus upon the specific issues of Big Data concerning the design of the algorithms. The Malaysian side shall also work on the dual aspects of Single Instance Machine Learning and Multi-Instance Machine Learning that is prevalent to the nature of data collected. In the same phase the Indonesian side shall work on mining the data from different sources related to lifestyle diseases, and storing it in the form of an ontological database. The work will be to parse as many textual sources as possible, coming from different and diverse sources, to infer the ontology from the same, and to suitably store them in the knowledge base. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                The fifth phase at the Indian and Malaysian side will make mechanisms to interact with the user. The interaction may most simply be using a mobile (android) or a web interface. The user will be able to upload the data and statistics, or the mobile may be able to get it from the system if already available. The web/mobile interface will give the feedback to the user telling the user about the presence or status of the disease, whether the disease is growing, the precautionary steps to be taken, advise on eating and exercises, etc. Such an interface can be a little daunting, especially if the person is a patient who is already hospitalized. To make the interface more socialistic in nature, the interface will also be made on a NaO humanoid robot, which is a socialistic robot. The robot will use its audio and actions to tell everything about the disease to the user. The human will be able to give voice commands, thus in a way ‘talking’ to the robot to get more information. The robot can gesture actions as necessary to explain the fatality and give advices as humans normally tend to do. The Indian side shall concentrate on making the decision support system and recommender system, based on the data. This calls for making intelligent learning based system that makes a decision to be reported to the user. The Malaysian side shall make the web and mobile interface. The Malaysian side shall also make visualization tools and techniques to be presented on these interfaces. The robotic interface will be made at the Indian side. Simultaneously, during the fifth phase the Malaysian side shall work on the data generated in the project, using the algorithms proposed by the Indian side for testing the machine learning and big data. The work at the Malaysian end will be to use their Big Data centre to do all the analysis of the algorithms on the generated data sets.
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                At the fifth phase, the Indonesian side shall work on the Ontological/Semantic Search and Reasoning. The aim will be to give an ontological search framework to the patients to know more about the lifestyle diseases and to search for any specific information. The Indonesian side shall make a suitable interface that lets the users search for anything they like, using the ontologies at the background to improve the search performance and getting the most relevant information. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                In the last phase the entire project will be tested as a whole. The main focus is upon the integration testing of the units. The testing will involve recording of live data from the users in India, to use the Big Data Centre at Malaysia to store, fetch and assess the data; based on which a decision comes. The decision is fed back to the user using the socialistic robot. The integral issues of the system as a whole will be noted and resolved. The phase also incorporates the analysis of the whole system and a detailed documentation of the algorithms and procedures involved.

                        This project develops a reasoning and decision support system for the Lifestyle diseases. The Lifestyle diseases are increasingly becoming widespread with the increasing stress levels of the modern youth. Technological advancements can be used for early detection, diagnosis, prevention, decision support and for advising the patient related to such diseases. Such systems are of immense help due to the benefits provided, thus saving the doctor’s time while also achieving high accuracy of decisions made, that can be ultimately attested by the doctor. The Machine Learning systems enable making rules without the need of the doctor, based only on a historical dataset. At the same time text mining and semantic reasoning based systems enable making use of knowledge available as raw text from doctors and scholars. The system on the whole can continuously interacts with the user to be more effective.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        This project uses the concepts of Big Data and Cyber Physical systems in order to make such a system. A lot of sensors are commercially available that give the body vitals of the human beings. The same sensors can be used to link the raw sensor readings to the medical state of the human being. The easy availability of subjects combined with the high dimensionality of the sensors results in a very large amount of data, thus requiring processing through big data centres. The back end of the system will require sophisticated machine learning tools and techniques, operating in a distributed mechanism. The machine learning algorithms shall capture both the temporal trends of the data, as well as the spatial features that enable making wise decisions. The project also explores the notion of text mining and semantic reasoning, thus benefiting from the wide variety of literature available for the domain. This enables the patients and the doctors to carry more focused searchers and enables more informed decision making. The project interacts with the users using specially made interfaces consisting of web, mobile and a socialistic humanoid robot.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        Through this project the aim is to make a complete system using which the users can get an early indication of the development of the disease, the patients can get regular monitoring and assistance regarding the disease, as well as the doctors can get help in the diagnosis of the disease. The complete system is powered by the innovative machine learning algorithm that the group aims to develop as a part of the project. At the same time the system draws its decision making capability based on the text mining done on medical data collected from different sources, represented in an ontological framework. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        The system on the whole will be able to give personalized recommendations based on and learning from an individual user, or make collaborative decisions and recommendations based on the learning from a population constituting all the users.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        The biggest advantage of the project is the complimentary of the teams coming from India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Each of the groups has a unique contribution towards the project. The Indian team primarily contributing towards the Machine Learning and Socialistic Interaction with the user; the Malaysian team specializing and contributing towards the Big Data aspect; while the Indonesian team adds the text mining aspect to the project. Besides, having three different teams collect data at three different nationalities with different subjects and under different contexts, gives the possibility to create a unique data set for which a lot of research can be done in the future.
