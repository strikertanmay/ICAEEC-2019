                                The first phase of literature review runs in parallel for all the countries. Considering that significantly less work is available in the lifestyle diseases, this phase looks into a lot of literature that will aid in designing of the complete system. This phase is also to develop a clear understanding of the overall project design, and the contributions of each of the parties, especially stressing on the interfaces between the modules.
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                The second phase involves all the design aspects of the data that shall be collected from a variety of sensors. The phase involves making all critical decisions regarding the data, including the choice of sensors, the kind of users whose data is to be recorded, and all strategies to record the data. The phase, backed up with literature, lists out all the lifestyle diseases and the suitable data and sensors for each of them. The frequency of data can be a very important parameter for diseases wherein a temporal trend is important. The optimization of the entire process, so as to most efficiently record the data is of vital importance. The phase also investigates all the publicly available datasets that can be used for the purpose. At the same time the Indonesian side shall work over the design of a suitable ontology that specifically is for the Lifestyle based diseases. The ontology shall be generalized enough to model all the criticalities of the problem, while also enabling an easy representation and easy inference.
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                The third phase is to record the data from different kind of test subjects. The data is multi-modal in nature, wherein different kinds of sensors give data of different types. Further, the nature of the data will be different for different types of lifestyle diseases. The data collection shall be done simultaneously for the Indian and Malaysian side. This will ensure a high diversity of data, for a greater understanding of the problem and better analysis. The data will be acquired for a large duration to get the temporal trends. The acquired data will be pre-processed for removal of noise and segmenting out the effective part of the data. Further, strategies to integrate data from different sensors and different modalities shall be made. All data shall be hosted at the Malaysian side, which shall act as a central repository for the data. The Indonesian side, during this phase shall be involved in designing of algorithms for mining of text from different sources available for lifestyle diseases. Again the different sources have their own structure and peculiarities that makes the design of suitable algorithms a challenging affair. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                The fourth phase is devoted to the development of the Big Data based machine learning and decision support system solutions for the acquired data. The first way to look at the problem is to see the temporal data to fetch the trends. One can look at the same patient’s data along with time to understand whether the person is slowly growing tendency of being diseased, or the person’s disease is growing/’reducing with time. A temporal analysis can also be used to predict the recovery or the development of a disease for the person. Similarly looking at the temporal data of the whole population, one can infer the trend of a particular disease and hence make decisions at a macroscopic level, whether some specific actions need to be taken. The data can also be used to understand the patterns that ultimately lead to a disease. In the same phase, the Indian and the Malaysian side shall simultaneously design a set of machine learning algorithms that help in disease identification. The Indian side shall be focused towards the design of innovative paradigms, specifically inclined towards the temporal aspects of the data. The Indian side shall also focus upon the choice of features, both from the temporal and spatial domain, and the selection of features out of all features possible. The Malaysian side shall focus upon the specific issues of Big Data concerning the design of the algorithms. The Malaysian side shall also work on the dual aspects of Single Instance Machine Learning and Multi-Instance Machine Learning that is prevalent to the nature of data collected. In the same phase the Indonesian side shall work on mining the data from different sources related to lifestyle diseases, and storing it in the form of an ontological database. The work will be to parse as many textual sources as possible, coming from different and diverse sources, to infer the ontology from the same, and to suitably store them in the knowledge base. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                The fifth phase at the Indian and Malaysian side will make mechanisms to interact with the user. The interaction may most simply be using a mobile (android) or a web interface. The user will be able to upload the data and statistics, or the mobile may be able to get it from the system if already available. The web/mobile interface will give the feedback to the user telling the user about the presence or status of the disease, whether the disease is growing, the precautionary steps to be taken, advise on eating and exercises, etc. Such an interface can be a little daunting, especially if the person is a patient who is already hospitalized. To make the interface more socialistic in nature, the interface will also be made on a NaO humanoid robot, which is a socialistic robot. The robot will use its audio and actions to tell everything about the disease to the user. The human will be able to give voice commands, thus in a way ‘talking’ to the robot to get more information. The robot can gesture actions as necessary to explain the fatality and give advices as humans normally tend to do. The Indian side shall concentrate on making the decision support system and recommender system, based on the data. This calls for making intelligent learning based system that makes a decision to be reported to the user. The Malaysian side shall make the web and mobile interface. The Malaysian side shall also make visualization tools and techniques to be presented on these interfaces. The robotic interface will be made at the Indian side. Simultaneously, during the fifth phase the Malaysian side shall work on the data generated in the project, using the algorithms proposed by the Indian side for testing the machine learning and big data. The work at the Malaysian end will be to use their Big Data centre to do all the analysis of the algorithms on the generated data sets.
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                At the fifth phase, the Indonesian side shall work on the Ontological/Semantic Search and Reasoning. The aim will be to give an ontological search framework to the patients to know more about the lifestyle diseases and to search for any specific information. The Indonesian side shall make a suitable interface that lets the users search for anything they like, using the ontologies at the background to improve the search performance and getting the most relevant information. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p class="">
                                In the last phase the entire project will be tested as a whole. The main focus is upon the integration testing of the units. The testing will involve recording of live data from the users in India, to use the Big Data Centre at Malaysia to store, fetch and assess the data; based on which a decision comes. The decision is fed back to the user using the socialistic robot. The integral issues of the system as a whole will be noted and resolved. The phase also incorporates the analysis of the whole system and a detailed documentation of the algorithms and procedures involved.
