                    In the modern day, we look at the system as a whole, starting from some sensors recording data, to intelligent decision making, and thereafter producing a physical effect on the environment by using actuators, operating in a feedback cycle mechanism to constantly control the system so as to reach a desired condition. Further, attributed to the widespread internet connectivity of small and large devices and advancements in Internet-of-Things, all sources of data generation, processing and actuation are inter-connected in a cyber-world, giving rise to Cyber Physical Systems.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                    Attributed to a large number of sensors actively working in different domains, the amount of data available for any problem by practical systems of today has exponentially increased. The sensors continuously fire high dimensional data that keeps getting populated in the database. Further, there is a sudden increase in the computational capability of the modern day systems, attributed to the models of high performance computing using a very large number of distributed computing units. This gives the backbone to analyze and learn from the data. Such Big Data systems have revolutionized computing in different real life applications.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                    Attributed to the small number of doctors catering to the needs of a large number of patients, the difficulty in getting appointments with the doctors, the increasing price of medical support and the extremely busy schedule of the doctors, it is imperative that the doctors cannot cater to all the needs of all the patients, and that many patients are unable to regularly consult the doctor. The role of the Medical Expert Systems is to let machines to some assessment of the patients based on the data generated by numerous sensors and medical reports. The machine assessment is then presented to the doctor, who now has a lesser work to do since he/she already has some information from the machine. The machines can specially be very useful when a regular monitoring of the patient needs to be done, so as to alarm the doctor when the body vitals of the patient show development of some abnormal trends. Similarly, the machines can be used by the prospective patient as a cheap precautionary method, in which case the machine can give an early detection of the disease and advise the person to consult a doctor. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The design of a Medical Expert System typically requires a large number of rules, which is a very difficult task considering the doctors lack expertise in systems and vice versa. A new trend is the use of a machine learning system, wherein a machine is given the reports of the past patients and the observations of the doctor. The machine then tries to learn or find a relation between the inputs in the form of the tests and body sensors, and the observations of the doctor. Hence no extra effort is needed from the doctorâ€™s side, who normally investigates the patient, thereby also generating the data for the medical expert system. The machines can observe the temporal data of the bodyand spot trends that may be very difficult for the doctors to observe. Things like a growing lobe, falling pulse rate, etc. are much easier for the system to observe, based on which that can take more informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                    While there is a limited raw data available or that can be recorded in a small time, the presence of a large number of preexisting information about the diseases is particularly exciting. A large number of medical repositories explain different kinds of diseases, their symptoms, precautionary advises, etc. This information is however is in the form of natural language and is therefore completely unstructured. Mining information from all these sources and representing them in the form of an ontological data set can result in more focused searches for both the doctors and the patients. If such an ontological framework is present, machine tools can be developed that assess the patients and make decisions. Such a framework compliments the data driven machine learning approach as medical decision support system.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                    The machine comprehension of the data generated from the patient is ultimately used for making decisions regarding the presence of disease, increasing/decreasing fatality of the disease, advise on eating habits, daily schedule etc. In some cases the advice is given to the doctor, for which a web or android interface is enough. However, many times the advices need to be given to the patient at home or admitted to the hospital. A component of the project is also to use a socialistic humanoid robot that interacts with the patient just like a nurse would do in the hospital. Being socialistic or human-like in nature, the robot is likely to be more effective than just a mobile or web-interface to which the patients may not readily relate to.

                        The medical domain is a very challenging domain because the doctors seldom have the knowledge of artificial intelligence based systems, while the technologists lack a medical knowledge. The project creates a complete solution to the problem by mixing the diverse technologies of Big Data, Distributed Machine Learning, all knit into the generic framework of Cyber-Physical Systems.

                        The project proposes the integration of information from two very distinct sources ontology based reasoning and a data-driven machine learning, for a multi-modal decision support system.

                        Lifestyle diseases are constantly increasing and are creating problems that need a proper technical attention for early detection, precautionary steps and continuous care and assessment. The project targets this specific type of disease that is both important and much has not yet attracted the interests of the researchers. Correspondingly the project aims to make a novel cyber-physical system architecture, specific to the domain/disease.
